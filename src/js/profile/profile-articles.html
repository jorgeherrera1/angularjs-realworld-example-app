<!-- 
  Updated from AngularJS to Angular:
  - Changed attribute binding syntax from list-config="$ctrl.listConfig" to [listConfig]="listConfig"
  - Removed $ctrl reference as component properties are directly accessible in Angular templates
  - Maintained the same component structure but with Angular binding syntax
-->
<article-list limit="5" [listConfig]="listConfig"></article-list>
